A basic wrapper around [Jdenticon](https://jdenticon.com/) for React.

### Usage

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Jdenticon from 'react-jdenticon';

function Example(){
  return(<Jdenticon size="48" value="Hello World" />);
}
```

### Help Wanted

I don't have time to maintain this library. The project doesn't currently have any CI/CD in place and no automated tests. Reviewing and testing PRs to ensure no regressions are made is something I need to solve before accepting any PRs that change the API. If anyone is interested in creating a little automation around these things, I'd be happy to accept a PR.
