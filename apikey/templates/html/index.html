      <h1>About</h1>
      <p> This website is trying to sell you the access to several finetuned language models.
        These language models aim to support: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Social scientists who cannot have enough of their interviewees' opinions </li>
        <li>Journalists/Marketers/Communicators who want to make argurments like their audiences </li>
        <li>Reasonable people who need to reason like the unreasonable </li>
      </ul>
      <p> Unlike mainstream language models trained by other businesses, our models are trained on the text data
        generated by multiple groups of interesting people until the models sounds like them.
        Other businesses aim to remove all biases from their models, they want their models to be helpful, logical and
        reasonable. We want our models to sound like a normal human with all of their
        biases, preferences, hatred, fears, and so on.
      </p>

        This website is kept as simple as possible, partly because we do not have the resources to be fancy.
        This is a privacy feature rather than a drawback actually. In fact, we do not ask you to register an account
        with us.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <p> In addition to finetuned lanaguage models, we also host several popular base language models.
        These language models aim to support: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Scientists who want to study and compare the behaviours of multiple models. </li>
        <li>Developers who want to find the most suitable model for their projects </li>
        <li>Reasonable people who want to play with open source models </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We are doing this because we know the pain of downloading 60GB of model weights just to get OOM messages.
        We want to support people test models concurrently and quickly.
      </p>

        <li><strong> If you have data generated by a specific group of people, we can colaborate. </strong> </li>
        <li> <strong> If you have an idea of training a new model and willing to pay for it, please let's us know.
