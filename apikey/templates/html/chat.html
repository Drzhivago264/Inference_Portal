        <h1>Hello Internet People!!!</h1>
        <p> This website is trying to sell you the access to several language models trained by Mr.H and Mr.B. 
         These language models aim to support: </p>
         <ul>
          <li>Social scientists who cannot have enough of their interviewees' opinions  </li>
          <li>Journalists/Marketers/Communicators who want to make argurments like their audiences </li>
          <li>Reasonable people who need to reason like the unreasonable </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Unlike mainstream language models trained by other businesses, our models are trained on the text data generated by multiple groups of interesting people until the models sounds like them.
          These businesses aim to remove all biases from their models, they want their models to helful, logical and reasonable. We want our models to sound like a normal human with all of their
          biases, preferences, hatred, fears, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other businesses want to create the next level of productive workers which are smarter, cheaper and less complaintive than you and your childrens. 
          We do not want to take your jobs away, we just want to make models that can be as mediocre as you with all of your fake passions, theories, opinions and ideologies.
          We are not particularly interested in statisticians' parrots, we are interested in human and their worldviews.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website is kept as simple as possible, partly because we do not have the resources to be fancy. 
          This is a privacy feature rather than a drawback actually. In fact, we do not ask you to register an account with us.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong> If you want to help please contact us</strong>   </li>
          <li><strong> If you have data generated by a specific group of people, we can colaborate. </strong>  </li>
          <li> <strong> If you have an idea of training a new model and willing to pay for it, please let's us know. </strong>  </li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Avaible Models</h2>
        <p>We currently offer the access to two models. 
          With your hard-earned money, we will deliver more models in the future. 
          
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reddit Helpers</li>
          <p>Reddit Helpers are trained on the data from r/advices, r/selfimprovement, r/personalfinance, r/datingadvice, r/NoFap subreddits.
            These communities consist of people who search or give advices on their personal problems.
            Even though, the quality of the advices are questionable, the contributors seem to genuinely 
            want to help.
          </p>
          <li>4Chan /pol </li>
          <p> 4Chan is a funny place on the Internet.
            We would never know for sure if we are talking to the governments, terrorists, prophets, aliens or just an another 
            angry fellow. The language used by 4Chan is hateful and offensive. It speaks up the voices that mainstream media wants to say but cannot. 
            4Chan is maintained because it can be located on some spectrums or matrixes that people use to classify people.
            It is convenient for people to communicate with 4Chan users via 4Chan. If there is no more 4Chan, they will make a new one.
