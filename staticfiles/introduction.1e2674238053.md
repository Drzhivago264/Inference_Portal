 &nbsp;  
This website is trying to sell you the access to several finetuned/base language models and the tools to interact with them. These language models aim to support:

- Social scientists who cannot have enough of their interviewees' opinions
- Journalists/Marketers/Communicators who want to make argurments like their audiences
- Reasonable people who need to reason like the unreasonable

Unlike mainstream language models trained by other businesses, our models are bent either by finetuning or prompt-engineering until they sound like specific groups of people. Compared to other businesses that want their models to be unbiased, helpful, logical and reasonable, we want our models to sound like a normal human with all of their emotions, biases, preferences, hatred, fears, and so on.

This website is kept as simple as possible, partly because we do not have the resources to be fancy. This is a privacy feature rather than a drawback actually. In fact, we do not ask you to register an account with us.

Regarding the tools incoporated in this website, we offer API endpoints and sandboxs to:

- Dataset labelling and/or modifying with large language models.
- Qualitative interview automating with Interview Agent.
- Assignment/Document writing and paraphrasing with Assignment Agent and LLM functions.
- Agents building or testing with Construction Zone and Your Template
 

There is no sophisticated agenda or argument to be made here, we are playing the role of a parakeet, repeating other people voices.
