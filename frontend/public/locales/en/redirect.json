    "Agent_Mode_Content": "An implementation of React agent that is capable of reasoning and acting in multiple prompt-response loops (default is 4). Agents are tasked with predetermined templates (e.g., writing assignment, writing advertisement materials, or protecting cat). Users can design their own templates for their agents. After the prompt-response loop is finished, the agent outputs the final result into a text editor.",

    "Data_Synthesis_Content": "This mode allows users to prompt LLMs for synthetic data generation. Users need to prepare a CSV that include seed prompts and responses. The seeds prompts are then enhanced and complexify by the model which then provides the answer for the generated prompts. This mode also includes allow users to edit the final outputs of the models to further improve their dataset."
