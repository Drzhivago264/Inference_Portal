/**
 * Specialized translator class that extends the BasicTranslator. It is
 * designed to work with PineconeStore, a type of vector store in
 * LangChain. The class is initialized with a set of allowed operators and
 * comparators, which are used in the translation process to construct
 * queries and compare results.
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const selfQueryRetriever = await SelfQueryRetriever.fromLLM({
 *   llm: new ChatOpenAI(),
 *   vectorStore: new PineconeStore(),
 *   documentContents: "Brief summary of a movie",
 *   attributeInfo: [],
 *   structuredQueryTranslator: new PineconeTranslator(),
 * });
 *
 * const queryResult = await selfQueryRetriever.getRelevantDocuments(
 *   "Which movies are directed by Greta Gerwig?",
 * );
 * ```
