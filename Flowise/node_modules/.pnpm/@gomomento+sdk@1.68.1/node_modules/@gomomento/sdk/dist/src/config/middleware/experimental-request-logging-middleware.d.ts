/**
 * This middleware implements per-request logging which can be used for
 * debugging.  The log format is currently considered experimental; in a
 * future release, once the log format is considered stable, this class will
 * be renamed to remove the Experimental prefix.
 *
 * WARNING: enabling this middleware may have minor performance implications,
 * so enable with caution.
 *
 * In order for this middleware to produce output you will need to have
 * set up your {Configuration} with a {MomentoLoggerFactory} instance that
 * is configured to log at DEBUG level or lower.  See `advanced.ts` in the
 * examples directory for an example of how to set up your {Configuration} to
 * enable this middleware.
