The Cohere TypeScript SDK provides access to the Cohere API from JavaScript/TypeScript.

## âœ¨ðŸª©âœ¨ Announcing Cohere's new TypeScript SDK âœ¨ðŸª©âœ¨

We are very excited to publish this brand new TypeScript SDK. We now officially support TypeScript and will continuously update this library with all of the latest features in our API. Please create issues where you have feedback so that we can continue to improve the developer experience!

## Documentation

Cohere documentation and API reference is available [here](https://docs.cohere.com/).

## Installation

```
npm i -s cohere-ai
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { CohereClient } from "cohere-ai";

const cohere = new CohereClient({
    token: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

(async () => {
    const prediction = await cohere.generate({
        prompt: "hello",
        maxTokens: 10,
    });
    
    console.log("Received prediction", prediction);
})();
```

## Streaming

The SDK supports streaming endpoints. To take advantage of this feature for chat,
use `chatStream`.

```typescript
import { CohereClient } from "cohere-ai";

const cohere = new CohereClient({
    token: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

(async () => {
    const stream = await cohere.chatStream({
        model: "command",
        message: "Tell me a story in 5 parts!",
    });

    for await (const chat of stream) {
        if (chat.eventType === "text-generation") {
            process.stdout.write(chat.text);
        }
    }
})();
```

## Errors

When the API returns a non-success status code (4xx or 5xx response),
a subclass of [CohereError](./src/errors/CohereError.ts) will be thrown:

```TypeScript
import { CohereClient, CohereError, CohereTimeoutError } from "cohere-ai";

const cohere = new CohereClient({
    token: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

(async () => {
    try {
        await cohere.generate(/* ... */);
    } catch (err) {
        if (err instanceof CohereTimeoutError) {
            console.log("Request timed out", err);
        } else if (err instanceof CohereError) {
            // catch all errors
            console.log(err.statusCode);
            console.log(err.message);
            console.log(err.body);
        }
    }
})();
```

## Beta status

This SDK is in beta, and while we will try to avoid it, there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning the package version to a specific version in your package.json file. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally looking for the latest version.

## Contributing

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, the code is generated programmatically. Additions made directly would have to be moved over to our generation code, otherwise they would be overwritten upon the next generated release. Feel free to open a PR as a proof of concept, but know that we will not be able to merge it as-is. We suggest opening an issue first to discuss with us!

On the other hand, contributions to the README are always very welcome!
