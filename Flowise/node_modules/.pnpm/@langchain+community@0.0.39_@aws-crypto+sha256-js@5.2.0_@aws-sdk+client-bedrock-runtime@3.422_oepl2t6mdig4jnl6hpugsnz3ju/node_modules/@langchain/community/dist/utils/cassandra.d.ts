     * Performs the actual initialization tasks for the CassandraTable instance.
     * This method is invoked by the `initialize` method to carry out the concrete steps necessary for preparing
     * the CassandraTable instance for operation. It includes establishing the Cassandra client (either by utilizing
     * an existing client passed as a parameter or by creating a new one based on the instance's configuration),
     * and executing the required CQL statements to create the table and its indices according to the specifications
     * provided during the instance's creation.
     *
     * The process encapsulates:
     * 1. Assigning the provided Cassandra `Client` to the instance, or creating a new one if none is provided.
     * 2. Creating the table with the specified schema if it does not exist. This involves constructing a CQL
     *    `CREATE TABLE` statement that includes columns, primary key configuration, and any specified table options.
     * 3. Creating any indices specified in the instance's configuration using CQL `CREATE INDEX` statements, allowing
     *    for custom index options if provided.
     *
     * This method ensures that the table and its environment are correctly set up for subsequent database operations,
     * encapsulating initialization logic to maintain separation of concerns and improve code readability and maintainability.
     *
     * @param client Optional. An instance of the Cassandra `Client` from the cassandra-driver package. If provided,

     *               is instantiated based on the provided configuration during the CassandraTable instance creation.
     * @returns A Promise that resolves when all initialization steps have been successfully completed, indicating
     *          that the CassandraTable instance is fully prepared for database operations.
