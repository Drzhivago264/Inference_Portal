## Quick Install

```bash
$ yarn add @langchain/community
```

This package, along with the main LangChain package, depends on [`@langchain/core`](https://npmjs.com/package/@langchain/core/).
If you are using this package with other LangChain packages, you should make sure that all of the packages depend on the same instance of @langchain/core.
You can do so by adding appropriate field to your project's `package.json` like this:

```json
{
  "name": "your-project",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "@langchain/<ADD_PACKAGE_NAME_HERE>": "^0.0.0",
    "langchain": "0.0.207"
  },
  "resolutions": {
    "@langchain/core": "0.1.5"
  },
  "overrides": {
    "@langchain/core": "0.1.5"
  },
  "pnpm": {
    "overrides": {
      "@langchain/core": "0.1.5"
    }
  }
}
```

The field you need depends on the package manager you're using, but we recommend adding a field for the common `yarn`, `npm`, and `pnpm` to maximize compatibility.

## ü§î What is this?
