/**
 * @security *Security note*: Make sure that the database connection uses credentials
 * that are narrowly-scoped to only include necessary permissions.
 * Failure to do so may result in data corruption or loss, since the calling
 * code may attempt commands that would result in deletion, mutation
 * of data if appropriately prompted or reading sensitive data if such
 * data is present in the database.
 * The best way to guard against such negative outcomes is to (as appropriate)
 * limit the permissions granted to the credentials used with this tool.
 * For example, creating read only users for the database is a good way to
 * ensure that the calling code cannot mutate or delete data.
