=======================

## 1.Common Errors

The server responds to a userâ€™s request by issuing status codes when the request is made to the server. Kindly refer to the table below to further understand the status codes when indicating the success or failure of an API call.

| Status Codes                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 400 (Bad Request)           | This is due to an invalid request and the server could not process the user's request                                                                                                                |
| 401 (Unauthorized)          | This is due to the lack of valid authentication credentials for the requested resource by the user                                                                                                   |
| 403 (Forbidden)             | This is likely indicating that your access is blocked by our server, and we're unable to authorize your request                                                                                      |
| 429 (Too many requests)     | This is likely indicating that the rate limit has reached. The user should reduce the number of calls made, or consider scaling their service plan that has much higher rate limits and call credits |
| 500 (Internal Server Error) | This is a generic error response indicating that the server has encountered an unexpected issue that prevented it from fulfilling the request                                                        |
| 503 (Service Unavailable)   | The service is currently unavailable.                                                                                                                                                                |
